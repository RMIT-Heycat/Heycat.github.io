											<h3>What does it do?</h3>
											<p>According to the definition on Investopedia by Frankenfield, J(2020), Cloud computing is the delivery of different services through the Internet. whose resources include tools and applications like data storage, servers, databases, networking, and software. And cloud server is one of the cloud services based on cloud computing. The server is a basic computing component consisting of CPU, memory, operating system, cloud hard disk, so the cloud server is a server delivered on-demand, calling on cloud resources over the internet and paying for them on a pay-per-use basis.</p>
											<p>As seen in TearchTarget, the benefits to using a cloud server as opposed versus using an on-premises unit include:</p>
											<ul>
												<li>1. Having rich specification types: A wide range of elastic cloud servers are available to meet different usage scenarios. Furthermore, each type of elastic cloud server contains multiple specifications and also supports specification changes.</li>
												<li>2. Having rich mirror types: Being able to be flexible and convenient to use the public mirror, private mirror or shared mirror application elastic cloud server.</li>
												<li>3. Having rich disk types: Cloud servers provide a variety of performance hard disks, to meet the needs of different business scenarios.</li>
												<li>4. Having flexible billing model: Cloud servers support for annual/monthly or on-demand billing model, according to demand fluctuations at any time to buy and release resources.</li>
												<li>5. Having data reliability Security protection: Cloud servers support network isolation, security group rules protection, away from virus attacks and Trojan horse threats; and Anti-DDoS traffic cleaning, Web application firewall, vulnerability scanning, and other security services to provide multi-dimensional protection.</li>
												<li>6. Being flexible and easy to use: According to the demand and policy, automatically adjust the elastic computing resources to efficiently match the business requirements.</li>
												<li>7. Efficient operation and maintenance: Cloud servers provide a variety of management methods such as console, remote terminal, and API, giving you full management control.</li>
												<li>8. Cloud monitoring: Using a real-time sampling of monitoring indicators to provide timely and effective monitoring and alerting of resource information, with notifications triggered at any time to respond at any time.</li>
												<li>9. Load balancing: Elastic load balancing automatically distributes access traffic to multiple cloud servers, extending the service capacity of the application system to the outside world and achieving a higher level of application fault tolerance performance.</li>
											</ul>
											<p>In the future, using cloud servers, software developers will not need operations engineers to put their code into production. Engineering teams will be able to pay more attention to achieve organizational goals. Instead of worrying about the upfront technical requirements of their work, teams will be able to deliver products faster and spend time evaluating the success of the delivered products. Cloud computing will improve as it is combined with Big Data and IoT technologies. Major technology vendors will join the integrated services, which makes it a trend. After processing and analyzing big data, big data can provide data that is identified with a specific business. Depending on the need, if cloud computing is integrated with Big Data and IoT, companies can increase their productivity, can gain access to key information about their competitors, and invest more effort in determining the future direction.</p>
											<p>According to the report from Kong(2018), "The future is serverless", which shows organizations that use serverless will be well placed to make this change. They work more closely in the DevOps role. Bringing infrastructure and code together. And the focus of serverless, speed, and agility means a greater focus on results.</p>

											<h3>What is the likely impact?</h3>
											<p>Artificial intelligence will increase the efficiency and speed of cloud computing. Cloud-based as-a-service platforms allow users to access machine learning capabilities such as image recognition tools, language processing, and recommendation engines at virtually any budget and any level of skill usage. Machine learning also plays an important role in the logistical processes that ensure cloud data centers function properly. Cooling systems, hardware networks, and power usage in these delicate and expensive environments are often monitored and managed by AI algorithms to optimize operational efficiency and minimize their impact on the environment. Research and development in this area are likely to continue to lead to new breakthroughs in data center speed and efficiency.</p>
											<p>Thanks to the cloud, more of us will be working on virtual cloud desktops where we can take advantage of hourly subscriptions for our time on the machine, eliminating the cost of hardware updates and therefore the got to eliminate redundant technology. It is also beneficial for security as companies can manage all devices centrally without having to ensure that everyone on the network is following best practices. As people join or leave the company, costs simply increase as the number of hours spent using the platform increases or decreases. This flexible functionality means virtual desktop services are likely to become increasingly popular within the coming years.</p>
											<p>As for the employment implications, the rise of cloud technology will replace and eliminate a number of repetitive menial jobs such as day-to-day office administration and financial management; also moderately complex jobs such as factory management, translation, security management, and driving services; and even some physical and mental jobs that combine information technology embedded in machines and equipment, such as delivery boys and travel customizers. However, it will also squeeze out a significant proportion of job content positions that are brain-intensive and inefficient to undertake manually, such as scanning and identification for image monitoring; it will also include positions that are beyond the sensory and reaction limits of workers and difficult to guarantee the quality, such as inspection and testing of precision instruments and emergency braking in assisted driving systems; it will also include positions where the working environment is not accessible to workers, such as conducting deep space exploration Occupational jobs will be performed by intelligent robots.</p>

											<h3>How will this affect you?</h3>
											<p>The future is accompanied by cloud technology. Our life may look like this.
												After washing up in the morning, eating breakfast, turning on the computer, and turning on music, the day begins. This is the life of many freelancers, who do not have to squeeze the underground or the bus but can do all kinds of things at home, realize the online office, and choose to play songs in the music app if they like. They can also do online shopping and order takeaways without leaving home, and these services offer delivery to their door. If you go out, you can also set up navigation and provide intelligent travel solutions to avoid congestion.												
												</p>
											<p>With the development of network technology, especially the rise of cloud computing, web-based and online working is increasingly being practiced and it is not necessary to bring all the relevant people together to complete a task. As a technical person, this is particularly evident when you are at home or on the go, with only a laptop and 4G network, you can immediately deal with the problem. Perhaps in the near future, as cloud computing technology continues to develop, the concept of the office will disappear and I will be able to work from home.</p>
											<p>And for my family and friends, they will be greatly improved in terms of education and housing.
												The development and application of education on a cloud technology platform are known as the 'education cloud'. Education is characterized by a huge amount of resources, scattered information storage, and difficulty in sharing. Now, through cloud computing, we can enable the different players in education - teachers, students, parents, education departments, and so on - to educate, teach and communicate on a cloud technology platform. For example, the 'Open Classes' on many websites allow many students to enjoy advanced education courses from other outstanding universities												
												</p>
											<p>The smart home connects various devices in the home (such as audio and video equipment, lighting systems, air conditioning controls, security systems, etc.) together through IoT technology to provide a variety of intelligent functions and uses. Today's smart home is in fact a small Internet of Things for the home, through various sensors, collecting relevant information, and through the analysis of this information, feedback, to achieve the relevant functions. With the smart home, all household chores can be done without hands, and all devices at home can be controlled by voice, greatly enhancing the living experience.</p>
