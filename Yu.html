										<h1>YU JI</h1>
									</header>
									<p>My name is Yu Ji from the group “hey cat”,and my student number is s3725496. But feel free to call me Irene. I come from Tianjin, north of China. Tianjin is a beautiful and relaxing coastal city. I've lived in this wonderful city until I graduated from high school (18years old). After graduating from high school, I decided to study abroad in Melbourne in 2018. I finish my language and foundation year courses at Monash college in the Monash city campus until 2019. My hobbies are playing with my pets and doing handy work in my free times. I really enjoyed the quiet and relaxing time. I am also very interested in working in IT, but don't have a lot of experience. In my first-year course this year, I learnt some basics of making web pages and Python programming and database statistics.</p>

									<span class="image main"><img src="images/yu test3.png" alt="" /></span>
									<p>According to the three-test results, it is indeed very similar to my usual performance. I am relatively outgoing and like to communicate and share with other people. Ideal for leadership roles and tasks that require communication and analysis with a team. I am caring and sensitive to the emotional changes of others and am also well suited for consulting and service work. However, my imagination and creativity are relatively low. Perhaps I am relatively conservative in my thinking and not bold enough and need to keep learning to improve my confidence and ability in this area.</p>
