											<h3>What does it do?</h3>
											<p>According to the definition in Wikipedia, robots include all machinery that simulates human behavior or thought and simulates other living things. At the same time, some computer programs are also called robots. In modern times, through computer programs or electronic circuit control, robots can automatically run man-made machines and equipment with tasks set up to replace or assist humans in their work. Robots can also do some tasks that are highly repetitive or dangerous, and they can also do some tasks that humans cannot complete due to size limitations, such as outer space or deep sea operations.At present, the global robots are mainly divided into several different fields.</p>
											<p>1. Household robots. Household robots are special robots that serve humans. They are mainly engaged in household services, maintenance, transportation, cleaning, monitoring, etc. The types can be divided into electrical robots, chef robots, handling robots, immobile robots, mobile assistant robots and other types of robots. Human robot. Among them, electrical robots are the first of the most popular types of robots in modern times. This kind of robot can replace people to complete home services. It contains a variety of sensing devices, such as traveling devices, receiving devices, sending devices, control devices, execution devices, storage devices, interactive devices, and so on. The device transmits the information sensed in the home environment to the control system, and then sends instructions through the control system to proceed to the next step. Electrical robots can complete safety inspections, cleaning and sanitation, article handling, home appliance control, disease monitoring, etc.</p>
											<p>2. Industrial robot. Industrial robots are machines and devices widely used in the industrial field. They have a certain degree of automation and can realize various industrial processing and manufacturing functions. Industrial robots are widely used in various industrial fields such as electronics, logistics, and chemicals. Compared with traditional industrial equipment, industrial robots have many advantages. For example, robots have the characteristics of ease of use, high level of intelligence, high production efficiency and safety, and easy management. At present, industrial robots have a good performance in many fields such as automobiles, space shuttles, and military equipment. At the same time, industrial robots are gradually extending to food, medical and other fields. Compared with manual operation, the robot issues instructions through the control system, which can perfectly complete all tasks and avoid mistakes. Industrial robots can work in a 24-hour cycle, and can achieve the maximum output of the production line. After the production line is switched to industrial robot production, the company only needs to leave a few employees who can operate and maintain the industrial robot to perform maintenance tasks on the industrial robot. In addition, with the expansion of human exploration of space, industrial robots can also use their intelligence to successfully complete tasks in extreme environments such as space, deep water, and nuclear environments.</p>
											<p>3. Military robots are automatic machines with some functions similar to humans used in the military field. From material transportation to search and actual offensive, military robots are widely used. Replacing soldiers with robots can perfectly prevent soldiers from performing tense combat actions and heavy physical labor. At the same time, it also avoided losses caused by man-made combat operations and reduced casualties. This robot can work in a variety of harsh combat environments, and in the future can complete dangerous and arduous tasks, such as explosions, clearing obstacles and clearing landmines on the battlefield. Military robots can automatically recognize terrain and objects, and quickly make judgments based on external conditions.</p>
											<p>In the future, the main research direction of robots will be artificial intelligence. Robots need to learn new skills through trial and error, multiple units share experience to improve learning efficiency, and can prevent and repair failures by themselves. Through the research of deep learning technology, these goals will be accomplished in the future.The current core issues in the research of intelligent robots have two aspects: one is the need to improve the autonomy of intelligent robots, that is, the hope that intelligent robots will be further independent of humans and have a more friendly human-machine interface. The operator only needs to give the task to be completed, and the machine can automatically form the steps to complete the task and complete it automatically. On the other hand, it is necessary to improve the adaptability of intelligent robots and strengthen the relationship between robots and the environment.</p>

											<h3>What is the likely impact?</h3>
											<p>Obviously, the development of robotics has brought many impacts to human society. First of all, the use of robots reduces the damage caused to employees in the workplace. In the manufacturing industry, there are many processes that pose risks to humans. A large number of load-bearing tasks can cause physical injury to employees. Employees may make mistakes when operating equipment. Welding and deep-sea operations will have high-temperature and high-pressure environments that people cannot handle, and some environments will release harmful fumes. The robot can perform all these tasks without health problems. In addition, the use of robots can reduce production costs. The robot works by running the programmed program, which can effectively reduce the consumption of human resources. A qualified and skilled employee needs to consume a lot of time for training, and the robot can directly start the job through the control of the system. This is a way that is not only convenient, but also more efficient. Unlike humans, robots do not need to rest, which allows them to work 24/7 to increase production. The robot never asks for vacation or departure, nor does it require wages.In other industries, robots also have far-reaching influence, such as home robots that are closest to life. The convenience brought by household robots to life directly affects countless ordinary people.The robot technology allows people to free their hands and enjoy life easily.</p>

											<h3>How will this affect you?</h3>
											<p>For me, the development of robots has had a profound impact on my life. In my daily life, I will use the sweeping robot to clean the house. When I need to clean my home, I only need to start various household robots, and they will clean up in accordance with the procedures that have been set. I can do whatever I want during this time, and cleaning is no longer a time-consuming and laborious job. For people, it is difficult to pay attention to small places such as corners, under sofas, and under beds. How to thoroughly clean these places has always been a big problem, and the emergence of household robots has solved these problems well. The short stature of the sweeping robot can get under the sofa, and the special-shaped rag of the window cleaning robot can The dust in the corners of the window glass is swept away, and the air purification robot can also catch harmful particles in the air. In addition to convenience, the robot also has a small footprint for easy storage. In the manual cleaning process, a lot of cleaning tools are used, such as mops, brooms, vacuum cleaners, etc. These cleaning tools once occupied a lot of area in my home. With all kinds of domestic robots, more space is freed up in the home.My family prefers smart speakers. This kind of speaker allows people to perform a series of operations through voice, such as on-demand songs, online shopping, and control of smart home devices. With this intelligent robot, we can open the curtains, set the refrigerator temperature, turn on the light switch with just a few words.</p>
