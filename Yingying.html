										<h1>Yingying GUO</h1>
									</header>
									<p>My name is Yingying GUO, a member from group ‘HeyCat’ and my student ID is s3860867. I am from Guangzhou, China and I am studying for a Bachelor of Information Technology in my second year. Before studying in RMIT, I majored in Computer Science for two years in Beijing Normal University in Zhuhai. I like traveling, photographing, camping and playing ball sports, like basketball, football, table tennis, badminton, biliard in my free time. My interest in IT is on how the facility connects to my smartphone which is a type of technology called Internet of things, and network security of how to protect my privacy data on the internet.</p>

									<span class="image main"><img src="images/yingying test 2.png" alt="" /></span>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/yingying test 3.png" alt="" /></span>
									<p>These three test results show that I am an outgoing, enthusiastic, and helpful person. I have a strong sense of responsibility and when I set my mind to something, I stick to it and get it done, so I can always get things done reliably. However, I tend to be too idealistic and whimsical and tend to overthink things. I also care too much about the feelings of others and can't realize if it's my fault and blame myself. But as a member of a team, I will be a good co-worker. I can learn new things quickly and perform many tasks well. I am open to others' opinions, which allows me to relate well to my colleagues. I can study in different types of ways to acquire the knowledge I want.</p>
