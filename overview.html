											<h3>Topic</h3>
											<p>The name of our software is ABaABa, inspired by the idea that babies can only make simple sounds and words when they are first born. But now the possibilities are endless at this stage, time and environment can allow them to learn any language. The aim of our project is also to create an environment where people and language professionals can learn a language. This application will help them to learn a new language more easily or to achieve higher levels of success in their language work. Trying to fully master a language to a professional exam or certification level is not an easy learning process. There are a variety of language learning providers and online language learning applications on the market today, very few of which are comprehensive or specifically targeted (focusing on application testing or qualification exams) language learning applications. In this multilingual learning and education software, users can learn a language in great depth and gain the ability to take workplace competencies such as IELTS, TOEFL and other language professional exams or translation qualifications.
											</p>
											<p>To achieve this, the project team needs to bring together a number of experienced language teachers or language workplace veterans to draw on their experience and advice to create live and recorded courses that users can study. In addition to this, we will encourage users to learn more than one language by offering free basic experience courses in different languages, especially minority languages. A study guide and career planning advice will be provided in the help function on the account page in the course app. For example, what materials and websites users need to use to prepare for the IELTS exam, as well as exams and study tips on how to get certified to work in a language. Users can read these guides to get a general idea of how to study before deciding what course to take, thus saving time searching and consolidating these different types of information on other different websites. Language workers will also get some advice from career planning. As the app is very targeted, users can find out most questions related to learning language applications. There will also be a page that simulates an online classroom model where users learning the same language can communicate and practice. This avoids the disadvantage of learning alone online without being able to communicate and practise with others.</p>

											<h3>Motivation</h3>
											<p>With the development of the Internet, people may waste a lot of time searching for duplicate information. In order to avoid such problems, we decided to create an application dedicated to language learning. Most existing language applications have a single function. These applications allow users to learn specific languages or allow them to be used exclusively for certain types of exams. We want to create an application that is rich in content and integrates all language learning information on the market. Any beginner can get the most comprehensive guidance from this application.</p>

											<h3>Landscape
											</h3>
											<p>With many applications and products out in the market, there are bound to be some products that are similar to the likes of ours. Some of these include Duolingo, LanguagePerfect and Busuu. These are our competitors as they are software-based language learning systems and can all be used as apps on phone devices, allowing for easy-access and hence are the mainstream ones. The main difference between Duolingo and our learning system is that ours will develop language skills at a casual, academic and professional level with courses catered to each skill type depending on the user. Our application is also targeted for people wanting to get into a particular career via the development of a new language or students wanting to pass their language exams like TOEFL. This differs from other mainstream products like Duolingo and LanguagePerfect as they are intended for more casual learning, potentially targeted at people who are travelling and want to learn a few words and sentences to assist them on their stay.</p>
											<p>Our program also has a designated certified language teacher whose role is similar to an offline teacher, staying with a specified group to offer more assistance and assign more complex tasks. Meanwhile, other language programs mainly rely on users to repeat lessons, which only refines their current knowledge as opposed to expanding on it like our project intends to. These groups are designed similar to Microsoft Teams, in that users can practice their communication skills as though they were in a classroom in real life, aimed to enhance their learning and progression as opposed to the lack of peer-to-peer interaction in Duolingo and LanguagePerfect. This in comparison to our project means that there is less practicality and application of the knowledge learnt, as well as being limited on what is being taught, while users learning on our application can develop speaking and listening skills as well as get personal assistance on something they are concerned with. Since many users tend to learn a language as a means of being able to converse with others rather than just write and read, we believe that our learning environment is more suitable for users who are more serious about learning a language, and hence will give us a significant advantage over our competitors. </p>
