										<h1>Yahui Qin</h1>
									</header>
									<p>My name is Yahui Qin from the group hey cat and my student number is s3730980. I was born in China, and when I finished high school, I went to Australia for undergraduate studies.In my free time, I like to play games with my friends, which also leads me to be interested in how to make a game. After understanding, I chose the IT industry. In addition to programming, I also like software design. The process of starting from nothing excites me and stimulates my motivation. I already have some experience in java and web page production.</p>

									<span class="image main"><img src="images/yahui test2.png" alt="" /></span>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/yahui test3.png" alt="" /></span>
									<p>Based on these three tests, my style is biased towards practicality and observation. If I have a new idea, I will try it quickly and gain experience first. I am proficient in the way of interacting with people, can treat everyone with enthusiasm and am willing to help others solve problems. This makes people very comfortable and relaxed when they get along with me, which makes teamwork more smooth and successful. I like to complete tasks with others, and hope that my actions and myself can be recognized and appreciated by others. I will do my best to complete the task, and I am fully aware of my responsibilities.  </p>
