										<h2>Group Progess</h2>
									</header>
									<p>Our work in A2 went very well and each team member worked well together to achieve a good result. The project idea for our group project was approved by each group member and the lecturer, in which the basic  function and purpose of the page was planned.
										In A3 we describe in detail the individual functions in the project and how to implement them. We have removed some functions that are not particularly necessary or repetitive, for example the forum page can be combined with the study page. A description of the testing sessions has also been added. Finally , we designed and made concrete pages with the features we imagined for the software in Figma.</p>
