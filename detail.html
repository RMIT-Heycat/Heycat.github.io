											<h3>Aims</h3>
											<p>At ‘Heycat’, The aim of our project is to provide an application that caters to learning languages for exams, professions and at a casual level. In order to be able to deliver our product effectively we will need to focus on maximising interaction between users and teachers/peers, having an easy-to-use GUI that distinguishes the different services (IELTS preparation, job training) and providing personalised lessons with exercises appropriate to the user’s ability and goals. Having a simple, easy to use and appealing GUI is essential to every application, which is no different to our language application. As our product is designed to deliver more than the usual services of other language apps, we have to streamline these functions into easy to distinguish sections so that the user does not get lost or confused. From the different proficiencies in the language, what they are training for, what group they will be in and organising exercises, there is so much that will have to be separated so that our design isn’t complicated, and the main functions that the user is particularly interested in will be easy to find.
											</p>
											<p>As we are trying to have an engaging app that can develop user’s speaking and language abilities, our goal is to maximise interaction by establishing a classroom-like setting online where there will be a small group of students and a teacher. This is similar to Microsoft Teams, and will have basic commands like “raise hand”, being able to mute themselves, a language keyboard, and a webcam option. By simulating a classroom, speaking can be practiced between other committed students with a teacher monitoring and operating the lesson. In conjunction with the teacher providing offline work/material, students can further improve their learning as if they were at an actual language school, with the benefit of it being easily accessed online.</p>
											<p>Our last goal is to deliver a personalised experience, where the user’s language proficiency, language they want to learn and what they are developing their skills for will be considered so that we can deliver the most optimal services. For example, a beginner who wants to learn Korean for casual speaking/a hobby would have a contrasting different learning approach than an international student learning English for university. Finding these user differences and setting the most appropriate learning scheme is important to having a successful learning application that maintains their interest.
											</p>

										<div class="col-6 col-12-small">
											<h3>Plans and Progress</h3>
											<p>Our project was originally proposed by one of our group members. This group member had to learn about IELTS because he was coming to Australia to study. However, this group member did not have a very good foundation in English and therefore enrolled in offline courses at various training centres in order to eventually achieve the IELTS standard. These offline courses were very expensive and because they were offline, they also added a lot of inconvenience. For example, for students with a poor foundation, it costs a lot of course time and money just to catch up on the basic course. The cost of the courses required to reach a professional level where you can take exams or certificates is a staggering figure. In addition, the average amount of time each student is allocated to practice in class is limited. There is also no guarantee that the teacher will be available 24 hours a day to answer questions after class. Finally, most of these offline establishments are located in commercial office buildings in the city centre, which means that students in remote locations spend a lot of time travelling each day.</p>
											<p>Therefore, this group member came up with the idea of developing a language application, taking into account his own experience. After some discussion, we decided to adopt the group member's idea. We decided to develop a project about language learning.
												After deciding what project to do, we had another discussion about how to innovate our application. Because there are already a lot of language applications on the app store, we needed to be innovative in order to be different from other language applications. After downloading and reviewing many language applications, we decided to add these features to our application.
											</p>
											<ul>
												<li>Homepage</li>
												<li>Courses (online courses: help with IELTS exams, etc., practice, after-school class groups:teaching assistants to help students learn)</li>
												<li>Study room (quiet room, free talk room and dubbing room)</li>
												<li>Account page (personal information, setting, support)</li>
											</ul>
											<p>In the homepage, there are two parts. One is learning progress, another one is course recommendation. For the online courses, our team decided to include free experiential lessons. For example, experiential basic courses between different languages. Our aim is to encourage users to learn more languages to give them a competitive edge, either to improve their personal skills or to help them find a job in the future. Or free basic introductory courses for different exams or certificates, giving our users the freedom to choose the course that suits them. The feature also includes practice, which is divided into two sections. The first section is an after-class exercise for the lesson content, which will help users to review and consolidate. The second part is a reading resource, when the user is reading a book and encounters a word they do not know they can select it and then the pronunciation of the word, the explanation will appear. Clicking on the word again will redirect the user to a new page which allows the user to follow the tutorials to practise pronunciation of words they don't know and get an evaluation so that they know if they have mastered the correct pronunciation of the word. We have also included an after-school group, which is one of the innovations. After class, students have questions, but teachers may not be able to answer in time, so we will place 3-5 professional teaching assistants in the group for each course to help the teacher answer students' questions. The Teaching Assistants lead and monitor each student through each day's lesson on time and point out any shortcomings for repeated practice. In addition to this, this application has study rooms for users. The study room is divided into a completely quiet room and talking room. In quiet rooms, users can enjoy a quiet study environment with other users, while there are free talking rooms and dubbing rooms in the talking rooms. In free talking rooms, users can communicate freely with others, share their study experiences and so on. Occasionally a teacher will be involved in each discussion room to help our users with their learning problems. The dubbing room allows users to dub the language relevant to the language they are learning, become proficient in the language and acquire a more authentic pronunciation. The last one is the account page. This contains the user's personal information, application settings and support. The suggestion of career direction advice in the support is another one of our innovations. Some users may want to choose a language career in the future, but if they don't know how to choose, they can seek advice from our in-app teachers to help them plan their career. Study guides in the support provide users with the study materials they need, such as IELTS exam materials, so that students know what materials they need to buy or consult. After deciding on these features, we started to create a basic framework for our application based on these features, laying out  functional blocks.
											</p>
											<h4>Preliminary work</h4>
											<p>Through the preliminary understanding of product development knowledge, we believe that we need to assign existing members to different positions to complete our project through the content that each member is good at. The development of a product includes product demand analysis, planning and design, interface design, front-end and back-end development and testing. In view of the requirements of the project and the small number of team members, we decided to cooperate to complete the design part, and then separately complete the development and testing parts. According to the content of our project, we have compiled a product requirement table and based on this a general planning table, which includes the tasks we are going to complete at different time points. Next, we determined the functional overview of the software and got a preliminary understanding of the software technology that needs to be mastered.
											</p>
											<p>At the beginning, we planned to develop the functions of listening, speaking, reading and writing separately. For listening, speaking, reading and writing, we designed the functions of classroom and after-class exercises. Therefore, in each class, we carried out detailed differentiation and realization of each function, which led to too many and miscellany functions and too high repetition rate. When browsing, the function would feel too bloated, which was not easy for users to use, and also greatly increased the development time. Later in the team for the whole software function planning are discussed, to focus on this problem, and research among similar software function combination model, and made the corresponding software function analysis, found that most software will put together some of listening, speaking, reading and writing function, design a subject course, it contains several functions in listening, speaking, reading and writing, To achieve an overall functional module, and will not give the user a sense of separation, and then cause a cumbersome operation experience. Then we improve our function module design, module in class we design a whole language learning process, including read the new words in the process of translation, and example analysis to collect copy writing, and how to put him in writing of the exercise, in addition, also for business people, developed a special promotion course of foreign language communication, more focus on listening and speaking in this section, Understand the meaning of other people's words and perhaps some proverbs, and give clear and accurate feedback that is more appropriate to the needs of the people using them. In practice, we have developed a self-study room module, Freetalk chat room and dubbing performance module to meet the needs of learning. Users can increase the use and practice frequency of language through chatting and dubbing.
											</p>
											<h4>Product design</h4>
											<p>We are clearly aware of the user needs that need to be met for this language learning app of our group, so this allows us to easily plan out the functions that the product needs to guarantee. We will provide users with a simple and user-friendly mobile phone application. The functions included in the application include collection of user preferences, online courses, teacher Q&A, forum functions, and career guidance.After carefully discussing the visual effects that each part of the function should have, we first wrote a design document, which helps us have a clearer understanding of our product before drawing. In this document, we describe in detail how we should present each function of the application. For example, the online course function we provide is associated with which button on the main page, how do we put the thumbnail of the course video together with the text introduction in the interface of this function without affecting the aesthetics of the interface. The design document contains all the contents of the application, including the function flow chart, the function points of the product, the description of each function, the text copy, the pop-up box content copy, the relationship between the modules, the operation logic and the structural frame diagram. Through the study of UCD, we can well complete the preliminary design content of this part. Given that we are already proficient in Figma, a multi-person collaborative interface design tool, we decided to cooperate to complete the prototype design of the project. According to the plan in the early completed design document, we first completed the interactive prototype drawing and the prototype drawing explanation copy. After reviewing the prototype diagram and confirming that there is no problem, we began to work on the overall style of UI and the design of all visual effects.In this part of the work, we confirmed a set of overall design style, and used this to carry out the next interface design, including color, logo and icon selection. Finally, after the visual style has been determined, we design each page according to the interactive prototype diagram. In order to carry out the following work, we output a resource package, which includes the dimensions of the visual effect diagram, the cutting resource package, the explanation copy, the effect diagram source file, and all the visual effect diagrams. After completing all the above tasks, we have compiled a design summary that summarizes all the tasks of the design part in order to facilitate the handover with front-end development.
											</p>
											<p>When designing the interface, we designed too many interface plates because of too many demands. When realizing the prototype, we carried out too fine design and layout for each page, which led to too long time consuming, resulting in the later development. After the discussion in the group meeting, we decided to implement the basic course module in the first place, and then implement each section about StudyRoom. If there is enough room, we will consider joining the community section to increase the user's sense of learning involvement.
											</p>
											<h4>development phase</h4>
											<p>This part of the content is also what we are doing now: to provide all software technical support for our project. In view of the problem of shortage of manpower already mentioned, all of us have participated in the entire development process, using different people to complete the work of different content, and complete the work content in the most efficient manner. In the first step, the studio needs to convert the high-fidelity images after visual design into html and css, and use js to achieve its interactive effects. The front-end development of the project involves a lot of professional knowledge, so we spent some time reading and practicing. After mastering html+css, Javascript, Photoshop, flash, html5 css3 we started the formal development process. According to the content of our project, the six team members were divided into different tasks, namely overall structure construction, module production, page production, underlying JS construction, JS interaction effects, and internal testing. After the current period of work is ready, we begin to enter the code writing stage. We built the general HTML structure of the project and improved the page style based on the previous design documents. This part of the content involves too many code requirements, so we are still working on it. After finishing the content of the code, we will spend the next few weeks learning the expertise of back-end and operation and maintenance.
											</p>
											<p>JavaFX is used in the front-end page, but Python is used in the implementation of the crawling of various course materials and the call of open source language recognition packets. As a result, the two languages are not compatible in the database data processing and analysis in the back-end implementation, and the user interface cannot enter the database management system. Then link the database to the database to add, delete, check and change data processing. Therefore, a lot of time was spent debugging the changes for the compatibility of these two languages.
											</p>
											<p>When debugging went online, the number of people that could be accommodated in a study room was too low, which led to the fact that many people were online at the same time and the network could not be unobstructed. Moreover, the use of offline preset server equipment costs extremely high in both deployment and maintenance as well as debugging. Therefore, the Cloud server of AWS Cloud was used instead. Automatic control to prevent automatic scaling of peak demand and idling of low peak. In the test, only iPhone and some Android models were considered, while the front-end design screen only considered the screen of common models. When the software is applied to too small screens, such as iPhone 4, 5 and other models, a large amount of information will be lost or a large amount of blank space will be left. Certain screen actions are not compatible with these models.
											</p>

											<h3>Roles</h3>
											<p>Our group decided that it would be better to not define roles for members but to have us have an overall contribution to everything. Each week we would assign a certain task to a member, but they were not restricted to a certain area for the whole duration of the project. We decided to follow this direction as we all felt we could have an input no matter the field of knowledge. It was also easier to keep track of everyone’s progress as having roles makes us work independently but with assigned tasks we can expect what each person has to accomplish. When writing up the report we would designate any topic to a member or more depending on the thoroughness and depth needed, then we would all look at our work and contribute together by adding or correcting details. This was also applied for the graphical UI design, we all worked on the design at the same time working on the same concepts.</p>
										</div>
										<div class="col-6 col-12-small">
											<h3>Scope and Limits</h3>
											<p>In Assignment 2, we wanted to implement many features in our language learning application that were unique to us only, to make our product stand out against other mainstream learning applications, providing the things that they did not. As suggested in the mind-map below, we intended on having unique features such as an active discussion forum, where we could get inputs from professional writers to write tips on how to learn specific languages. It would be a platform where users can share their experiences on learning as well as ask questions and queries on the forums as well. Another main function that we intended to include was a chatroom where a group of users can go to communicate live to language teachers, acting as a classroom for users and students to learn actively whilst getting feedback directly from individual’s performance and skills. The teachers would then be able to assign tasks and test revisions to further enhance student’s learning capabilities. And our final main function was the learning of the language itself, a wide variety of target courses on speaking, listening, writing, and reading, with varying degrees of difficulty depending on the user’s needs.</p>
											<p>To keep us on track, we created a mind-map (shown below) of everything that wanted to include initially, and while this was everything that we wanted to include, we have decided to make some changes to it for various reasons. First off, we had to reduce the scope and limit some of the features that we originally wanted. Due to lack of time, we have decided to remove the forums section of the application as we feel like a classroom-like environment as well as the language learning function itself is more suitable to meet our goals and aim. To ensure that we avoid scope creeping, we will utilize the mind-map whilst reflecting off our aim and goal; developing the user's language abilities effectively whilst personalizing the learning experience, catering to individuals.
											</p>
										</div>
										<div class="col-6 col-12-small">
											<h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
											<p>Before building the project, we must first have a prototype of some kind to guide us and give us an indication of what we want for our group. For this, we used Figma and Draw.io. We first used Draw.io to design a diagram of what the functions of our application will have, advancing this by using Figma to design our prototype and present the functionalities (chat room and courses displayed) as well as the UI design of the home page and profile. After the prototype, a software is required for programming IDEs for coding in Java, XML and Objective C. Using an IDE for commercial business use would mean we would need the rights to a fully licensed version to be able to use the software long term and be able to utilise professional utilities offered by a full version of an IDE. The utilities include source control management to work in teams, graphical UI design, testing and debugging. An IDE that would fit our coding languages and compatibility for applications is Android Studio 4.2.1 and Xcode 12. We would also need licensing to a SQL database editor to store user information, such as Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS). For the sake of cost and efficiency, we would be using the Software as a Service (SaaS) to allow users to connect with just an internet connection and a browser.</p>
											<p>For hardware we would need computers/laptops to use the IDEs. As long as the devices have reliable memory and processing power there should be no issue. Our application will require a server to store and modify user information fast, so a computer that has a large amount of fast reading storage that is connected to a stable fast internet broadband would be essential to reduce the delay between the user and software. Other components such as memory with error-correction firmware and an additional power supply would need to be invested to ensure 24/7 operation.</p>
											<p>All our members have experience with Java, but most of us are at a beginner or intermediate level. As some of us are studying databases, all of us have fundamental knowledge of SQL and how to use queries in an editor to run basic commands on a database. A couple of us also have utilised XML to some degree (FXML in JavaFX), but not used it as a main language. Although we have not used Android Studio or Xcode, we have experience using other IDEs such as IntelliJ, Eclipse and Visual Studio Code. </p>
										</div>
										<div class="col-6 col-12-small">
											<h3>Testing</h3>
											<p>For project testing, we will start with internal testing after we have designed the basic functional sections within the application. First, we will create a test plan form where we fill in our team name, project plan, business plan, test tasks, needs, test schedule, where and when to test. Everyone in our team should try out our application and make suggestions on what needs to be improved. In addition to this, we needed to use a screener questionnaire to find more suitable potential users to test the application and we decided to use random interviews with potential users on the street. The filter questionnaire included a question asking what their occupation was and those who answered that they were students and language workers would be our test users, as would those who answered yes and interested in the question about the need for multilingual learning. Other respondents will be screened out of the rest of the test. These remaining users will help us to test the fluency of the application, the usability of the pages, the user-friendliness of the application and other issues. We use a small camera set up on the mobile phones we use for testing to record the users using the app and their suggestions for it with their permission. This gives us a very clear picture of how we want to use the software and the data we want to have during the test. After these basic tests, we need to refine our application based on the users' suggestions and to design our application in its entirety.
											</p>
											<p>We can also send out targeted invitations on social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, etc. to find international students and language experts whose needs are linguistically specific and match the type of application we are using, and who will give us more detailed suggestions to help us improve the application. After downloading and using the app, they are invited to answer a more professional questionnaire, which includes answers on what they think are the rules of language learning, how our pages are designed to be more efficient and focused on language learning, etc. Based on these answers, we will improve the design of the app.</p>

											<h3>Risks</h3>
											<p>Developing anything new always comes with many ups and downs, and our project is no different. While we want to provide users with everything that we have mentioned previously, there comes with many risks. One of the major risks we have is how we would entice people to use our application once it is up and running over the current mainstream platforms like Duolingo and LanguagePerfect. One possible solution to this is to have advertisements around social media such as Facebook and Instagram Another risk is that since our application does not function and operate as the mainstream language learning platforms, users may get confused or uncertain if they want to use our application. Hence, we aim to have the application built with a simple GUI that everyone can understand. A hardware risk that we may be wary of is our servers as it could also crash.</p>
										</div>
										<div class="col-6 col-12-small">
											<h3>Group processes and communications</h3>
											<p>Undeniably, communication is by far the most important aspect when building a project. When we first formed ‘Heycat’, we were all tasked to provide basic information on ourselves, sharing our hobbies, skills and our thoughts on working in a team. Through the tests that we all further took, results showed that while there are introverts and extroverts in the group, we valued communication as an essential skill when working in a team, leading us to often get in contact with one another for questions and queries. From the get-go, we created a Discord server to keep up group reminders and schedule times for our Microsoft Team’s meetings and calls. Every week we would have two scheduled video call meetings, one at the start of the week and one at the end of the week, finding time slots that are suitable for every member. For times when members cannot make a scheduled meeting, we would postpone the meeting and reschedule for another suitable time so that everyone can contribute and be on the same page from where we left off each session. With our consistent meetings, we are all able to keep track of who is working on which part, ensuring that we complete our project as efficiently and effectively as possible, whilst providing aid to each other when one requires assistance.</p>
											<p>And for hormones that have a blind spot in knowledge, we will assign the task of learning each one, and after learning together in a software that has never been used before to collaborate on our project.</p>
