										<h3>Minh</h3>
										<p>In our last assignment, we had strong organisation and communication skills with the group, so we continued with that throughout this assignment which helped us get through it well. While we have different time zones, something that we could all improve on is to update or message each other for any questions or queries outside of our scheduled meetings so that we could resolve any issues beforehand in order to be on task at our meetings. Something that was surprising to me was that while our group members have different time zones and extracurricular activities outside of school, we were also able to find times to fit in our meetings and work on our assignments together, getting along well. Something that I wanted to reiterate is the importance of communication and how well a group will perform if everyone keeps up communication and stays on the same page.</p>
									</div>
									<div class="col-6 col-12-small">
										<h3>Shuning</h3>
										<p>This time the group work was better than in A2, we were more familiar with each other and everyone was able to complete their own part carefully. However, there was something that needed to change. We were not as careful in assigning tasks this time as we were in the previous assignment, and we left the section of tools and technology behind, only to find that no one had written this section when we checked it for the last time. Luckily, we had enough time to make it up in the end. If we hadn't been careful enough when checking after the group, we would have lost the marks we should have received, which is very undeserved. Therefore, in future group assignments, it is important to check carefully and to double-check after assigning tasks to make sure that each task is done.</p>
									</div>
									<div class="col-6 col-12-small">
										<h3>Yahui</h3>
										<p>In this assignment, I think we cooperate very comfortably. Everyone is better at expressing and communicating with others than in the previous work.Obviously, we have learned a lot of knowledge about the IT industry through these two assignments, and can initially simulate the cooperation mode with others in the future work, which is very helpful for us to join the work after graduation.We also have some shortcomings in this homework. In each meeting, we still cannot discuss the key content quickly and clearly, so we waste a lot of time in each meeting. If we need to hold a video conference in the future, we should first discuss the constitution of this conference by sending a message in advance, which can help us to be more organized in the meeting.</p>

										<h3>Yinying</h3>
										<p>In this assignment, I felt very good. Although we had no experience about the usage of Figma and the software development, we tried to learn it and use it in our work. That was a pleasant process when all members were striving for one job, and everyone made a difference. I guessed that the team-working experience was what was the biggest reward we got in this assignment. However, on the other hand, it also suggests we still lack specialized knowledge for our ideal job. The good thing is that in the period of rapid development of the Internet, we can quickly get the knowledge whatever we want through youtube, leetcode, linkedin, etc, which strengthens my determination to develop into a network engineer to help more and more people to be beneficial from the networking world.</p>

										<h3>YU</h3>
										<p>I feel that I have learnt a lot during this group work. As we had to describe all the details of the project idea this time, it gave me a comprehensive understanding of the process of creating a piece of software and the tools and techniques that need to be used. In addition, we had to prototype the pages using Figma and I learnt the most from this task. It was difficult to learn software from scratch as I did not have a lot of previous experience in this area, but it was also very rewarding. The process of designing the pages was very formative and exercised our thinking skills, we needed to think through the design connection logic of each page. This took us a lot of time, but the results were satisfying. And all the team members continued to be as cooperative in doing the task as they were in the last assignment, actively completing their part of the work at the end of each assigned meeting. When we encountered problems, we all communicated promptly. Good group members also contribute greatly to the completion of a good group assignment.</p>

										<h3>Kelvin</h3>
										<p>I believe we all did a good job on this group project as we all were cooperative, consistently contributing and could even handle designated tasks individually. What could be improved on is approaching tasks faster, maybe increasing workload each meeting or pushing the deadline faster for work as to leave more time for refining and fixing errors. The meetings are also quite long with a bit of idle time, so this can be improved on by being more efficient with time and discussion. One thing that surprised me was our ability to analyse together and how we approached this group project. What I learnt in groups is that there can be confusion when not all group members are on the same page, but when we get past this it is easier to complete a large project such as this one.</p>

									<h3>What went well</h3>
									<p>Communication is really important in group work. In this group assignment we were very prompt in communicating with each other. We will have our weekly video meeting on MS Teams on time to present our respective points of view. After the meetings, when we come across parts that need to be communicated, we also communicate in discord and exchange ideas. All these made it easier and more efficient for us to complete this group assignment.</p>
								</div>
								<div class="col-6 col-12-small">
									<h3>What could be improved</h3>
									<p>For this assignment we needed to make a prototype of the application and we chose to use Figma to make the prototype. However, none of the members of our group were very familiar with Figma and had to go through tutorials to learn it, but we spent so much time on the text content earlier that we ended up not spending much time on Figma and had to compress our time to complete our prototype. This is very bad and we should have studied the tutorials in advance rather than waiting until we were about to start working on it, resulting in a very tight schedule at the end. In future assignments, similar problems must not occur again.</p>
								</div>
								<div class="col-6 col-12-small">
									<h3>At least one thing that was surprising</h3>
									<p>Surprisingly, we were able to complete the prototype in a satisfactory manner without having much time left. At the beginning, everyone was not very familiar with using Figma and was not very happy with the first page design. We needed more specific and logical details about the functionality of the page and more plugins and patterns to make the page more colourful. We decided to finish the group meeting by learning how to use Figma ourselves on the internet and borrowing some templates that would make our task easier. In the end, after more discussions and based on what we had learnt and understood, we were able to improve the prototype page more and more.</p>
								</div>
								<div class="col-6 col-12-small">
									<h3>At least one thing that you have learned about groups</h3>
									<p>What we have learned about group work is that it is very important to communicate ideas and suggestions to each other in a timely manner. Because one person's knowledge is limited, but the combined knowledge of the whole group has unlimited potential. This is what group work is all about. Through communication, we filled in and drew on each other's expertise to complete a detailed description of such a huge project.</p>
