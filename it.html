										</div>
										<div class="col-6 col-12-small">
											<h3>Where does the IT professional spend most of their time?</h3>
											<p>People in the field of cyber security or security systems/programs tend to spend most of the time checking log entries to look for vulnerabilities and threats to prevent. Support technicians tend to spend most of their time answering tickets, looking at emails and answering phone calls. For software engineers it is mainly coding - working on projects or new ideas.

										</div>
										<div class="col-6 col-12-small">
											<h3>What aspect of their position is the most challenging?</h3>
											<p>The most challenging aspect of an IT professional’s position differs according to their role that they have. However, most can agree that figuring out ways to approach an issue or project as well as keeping the team on track would be quite challenging. IT professionals also have to research on how to resolve an issue that tends to be out of the scope of their training, which can be very time consuming. For big projects they will have to work overtime or continue to work at home in order to get it done before the deadline.</p>
