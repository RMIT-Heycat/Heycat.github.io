										<h3>Minh</h3>
										<p>One thing that went well was how organised our group was when it came towards having group meetings and the distribution of the work before the next meeting. It really helped keep everyone on track and committed instead of having people missing or going MIA. However, while we did arrange multiple meetings a week, we didn’t exactly have a detailed plan on what to do in that meeting so oftentimes we would waste time figuring out what everyone is at and what needs to be done. So that is something that I would like to improve on as a group, which comes back down to communication and the importance of it.</p>
									</div>
									<div class="col-6 col-12-small">
										<h3>Shuning</h3>
										<p>Our group did a great job in this assessment. One of the things that I think our group did well in this group work was that we had a clear distribution of tasks and each person was assigned a task that was appropriate for him or her and could do it well. The group members also check with each other to see if there is anything that needs to be improved. However, we still have something to improve. It was the first time we did the assignment as a group in this class and because of the time difference, we might not be able to contact the group members except for the meetings sometimes, so the communication was not timely and we could not communicate well about the assignment. Therefore, we must plan our time and communicate in a timely manner in future assignments.</p>
									</div>
									<div class="col-6 col-12-small">
										<h3>Yahui</h3>
										<p>The most important thing I learned in the process of teamwork is the ability to communicate with other people. In a job, people must be able to communicate well with teammates to complete tasks well. This assignment gave me ample opportunity to express my thoughts to my teammates.</p>
									</div>
									<div class="col-6 col-12-small">
										<h3>Yinying</h3>
										<p>I think one of the betss things that our group did well was that we all completed every assignment well and we were always on time. In addition, we would discuss the further delivery assignment at each meeting. In terms of improvements, I guess we should improve our usage of GitHub tools. As we didn't start with a local editor that was tied to the site, all the iterations of the website before it uploading to github were not saved, which increased the cost of programming time. Everytime we wanted to look for what we had written before we needed to write it again without the log.</p>
									</div>
									<div class="col-6 col-12-small">
										<h3>YU</h3>
										<p>I felt very good during this group work. All group members were cooperative and were motivated to complete their part of the work at the end of each meeting where tasks were assigned. Everyone also did their best regarding the assignment of tasks. Some people contributed a lot of content and others provided their technical support to help us build a perfect website. The most difficult thing is in this group project idea, everyone had a different project idea. It was hard to pick the most suitable idea to come up with, but after meeting and discussing. Instead of starting a whole new project, we decided to combine the best ideas from similar projects to form our own group project. This incident also made me realise the importance of group work, which can help us to complement each other's strengths and improve our ideas.</p>
									</div>
									<div class="col-6 col-12-small">
										<h3>Kelvin</h3>
										<p>Our group did a good job of allocating the work and completing the tasks on time, which was mostly handled in the team meetings. We were able to communicate clearly when we had issues, whether it was with the assignment or with our availability. The biggest improvement that we could make is improving the quality of our meetings, deciding what we will talk about so not much time is wasted being idle or thinking.</p>
									</div>
									<h2>Group reflection</h2>
										<div class="col-6 col-12-small">
											<h3>What went well</h3>
											<p>As a group, we all believed that communication was a priority skill to have. Thus, throughout the assignment, we would message each other on discord as well as Microsoft teams, arranging meetings every week to speak about where we’re at and what we’re up to. Everyone was on the same page, doing their assigned task before the next meeting which really made the assignment get done with ease as opposed to rushing it all last minute or everyone being all over the place. </p>
										</div>
										<div class="col-6 col-12-small">
											<h3>What could be improved</h3>
											<p>One thing that could be improved is that In future we should make a plan before each meeting. For example, if we have a meeting tomorrow, then we should decide today what should be discussed at the meeting tomorrow. That way, we don't spend a long time in the meeting in silence, thinking about what to say. This will improve the efficiency of our meetings.</p>
										</div>
										<div class="col-6 col-12-small">
											<h3>At least one thing that was surprising</h3>
											<p>The most surprising thing is a new group project idea was created, after we had given it some thought. This is not a completely new project, but a fusion of the individual ideas of the group members into a new project. Everyone made a contribution, which was great.</p>
										</div>
										<div class="col-6 col-12-small">
											<h3>At least one thing that you have learned about groups</h3>
											<p>One thing that we learned about groups is that we all have our own schedules that  we have to work around, which resulted in us having to be flexible and find time slots even when it wasn’t the most convenient for some of us individually. Trying to find the most optimal day and time for all of us became easier as we learnt each other’s schedules and established a weekly meeting time.</p>
										</div>
										<div class="col-6 col-12-small">
											<h3>Remember to include in your section on Tools how well you think your Github log of activity reflects your group’s work on this assignment</h3>
											<p>We are cost-effective and consistent by taking advantage of Github log, which is a very fantastic tool. It has recorded every commit since we created the repository, including uploading the original files, and making some updating of these files. Most importantly, once one of us completes the commits, all of us can see the change, which means we are no-needed to spend more time on transferring files to show the same effect on everyone's computer. </p>
